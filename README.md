# Dependencies

- npm
- bower
- grunt-cli
- Sass (>= 3.2)

# Installing dependencies

Install npm and Sass with your package-manager. On Debian-like systems run:

    sudo apt-get install npm ruby-sass

Execute these commands on your server as a normal user to prepare the dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/tcatm/meshviewer.git
    cd meshviewer
    npm install
    npm install bower grunt-cli
    node_modules/.bin/bower install

# Configure

Copy `config.js.example` to `config.js` and change it to match your community.

## dataPath (string)

`dataPath` must point to a directory containing `nodes.json` and `graph.json`
(both are generated by
[ffmap-backend](https://github.com/ffnord/ffmap-backend)). Don't forget the
trailing slash! Data may be served from a different domain with [CORS enabled].
Also, GZip will greatly reduce bandwidth consumption.

## siteName (string)

Change this to match your communities' name. It will be used in various places.

## mapSigmaScale (float)

This affects the initial scale of the map. Greater values will show a larger
area. Values like 1.0 and 0.5 might be good choices.

## showContact (bool)

Setting this to `false` will hide contact information for nodes.

## maxAge (integer)

Nodes being online for less than maxAge days are considered "new". Likewise,
nodes being offline for less than than maxAge days are considered "lost".

# Configure Client History

* configure the scripts in `py/`
* call them regularly via crontab or something similar

# Building

Just run the following command from the meshviewer directory:

    node_modules/.bin/grunt

This will generate `build/` containing all required files.
